                <p>The Coffee House is open in Westchase! We are excited to introduce our Coffee Shop & Cafe. If you crave great coffee, you’ll love knowing that we provide a real alternative to chains with handcrafted coffee and espresso drinks, a full tea bar, and real food options.<br>
                
                <br> Cafe delivers way beyond the traditional coffee shop favorites (although we think our homemade pastries are pretty good). We have traditional breakfast choices, including eggs and pancakes, and plenty of healthy options (including gluten free, vegetarian, and vegan). Our lunch offerings include a wide variety of salads,  sandwiches and flatbreads.   And as for the late nighters… we know you’ll appreciate having a spot for your dessert fix as well as a spiked coffee.<br>
                
                <br>And as a final quick intro to “us”- the owners: we are Westchase residents (no franchise or corporate owners in sight). Our first Grind, The Campus Grind, opened a few years ago at USF St Pete and has provided us with real world experience to make sure The Grind at Westchase can actually deliver what we promise- a great coffee shop/cafe experience.</p>
